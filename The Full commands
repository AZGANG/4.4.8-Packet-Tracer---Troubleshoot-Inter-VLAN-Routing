Troubleshoot Inter-VLAN Routing

"show ip interface brief" do first 
show interface g0/1.10
show interface g0/1.30
"show interface trunk" do first 

Part 1: Locate Network Problems
GigabitEthernet0/1.10  172.17.10.1     YES manual administratively down down "needs to be up and up"

int g0/1.10 has the wrong vlan configured 
int g0/1.30 has the wrong vlan as well 
no trunks have been configured on R1 same for sw1
wrong DG address 


Part 2: Implement the Solution
int g0/1.10
no shut 
int g0/1.10
encapsulation dot1q 40 

int g0/1.30
encapsulation dot1q 30

int g0/1.10
encapsulation dot1q 10

SW1
int g0/1 
switchport mode trunk 

fix end device address 

Part 3: Verify Network Connectivityint 
do pings 


Hint: If you need to reset a switchport to default configuration, use the default interface interface name command.
